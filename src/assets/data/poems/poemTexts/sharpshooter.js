my heartthrob sharpshooter, 
what happened, to you, to our future? 
i saw you golden, i saw you thriving 
every single target easily striking 
with light-hearted elegance and passion
a wish come true to see you in action. 
and now 
now you're missing what's right in front
a stumbling heartbreak, lying and drunk
paler everyday, you're spilling your quiver
keeping secrets, looking for sharks in a river 
i long for what i used to see
not this ghost of who you used to be.

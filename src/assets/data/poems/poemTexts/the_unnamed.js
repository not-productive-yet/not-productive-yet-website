export const theUnnamed = `
you and i sit in silent cries
same feelings, different lies
delluded and confused, except when
the pretense pauses for a moment

and then, with a hint of shame
someone can admit and reclaim
the shipwreck underneath
causing problems to breathe 

the next moment, it's out of focus 
and again we let dellusion loot us
but every time it reads the same
the sixth one for the unnamed

distant, like a lawyer on trial
you sit close and rationalize our denial
i see the flames, but still feel, full of hope
while you pour gasoline like no tomorrow
... at least we're both dellusional

the whole conversation never made sense
until that moment at the very end

hours later still frozen at our debris
forever haunted by your berlin breeze
i threw myself in your intense
led by heart and full of arrogance
didn't know our last kiss
was just that

but sure, take a picture
let it sink in that
even a goddess couldn't beat
your desired unavailability. 
--
love's a black market
and chaos rules after all
im still the lion
but you burned out

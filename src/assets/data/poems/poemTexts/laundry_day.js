i think i dropped some change
and also my soul on the way
my bones feel worn out
from trying to redecorate

im a gladiator wishing for retirement
my fabrics fade, dont tell on me
without permits i look for chemistry
hidden in trees and melodies

i suppose geography isn't relevant
and nihilism not that interesting 
your own lies are the most adamant 
now for that cell phone bleaching... 


i don't think there's a program for that
...or any of this

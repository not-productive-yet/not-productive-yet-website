export const forest = `
now i see where i have to go before i turn to dust
im kinda hopeful but still kinda lost
my head is stuffed with visions and dreams
but how i do i get the high i need
the planet is full of options, choices and information
also full of problems, mostly due to misscommunication
sometimes i like to ask the forest for answers
how do i get better while not losing my essence
how do i stay immune to all the things i hate
like money, judgment, apathy and constant complaints
how do i stay in this world
without "growing up" and losing my morals
and i cant fully give into it
unless i have a death wish
...
the trees stay unfazed by my complaints
unbothered they grow and stay
like nothing ever happened and nothing ever will
all the complaints in the world wont make them less chill
be it dramatic adolescent pains
or people cutting all their friends away...
maybe you'll change the world and maybe you won't 
just dont that make that dependent on people who've lost hope
take a deep breath of fresh air
feel it in your heart and your core
it cant all make sense
but you can still use the energy pulsating in your veins 
.. 
i didnt get the answers i was hoping for
but sometimes a heap of oxygen is all you truly wish for

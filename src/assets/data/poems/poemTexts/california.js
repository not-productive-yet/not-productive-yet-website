export const california = `
Will you take back my soul?
I've been flaunting words I don't really know.

My head hurts and what i say is empty, 
You're absent and you spilled your coffee;
Come over, we can trash talk the town, 
Buy some flowers, I'll make you a crown, 
Roll your eyes at the looks I steal, 
We can talk books and things we feel. 
Every day will be a little less dull
Until we're nothing but bones and a skull.

Layed this pipe dream in the sea of salt
Since it's probably me, after all~
Someone's feeling California now,
and I'm choking on a leftover doubt. `;

export const outTheWindow = `
you're divine magic, a work of art
calming my chaos-shaped heart

i'm re-editing playlists
and writing half poems
run by an impossible mix of impatience
and calm exhilaration
i dont know when i dont 
think of you

i'm the lion, you're the sun
i threw the structure out the window 
we will rule all that's to come 
we will rule, my bright one
`;

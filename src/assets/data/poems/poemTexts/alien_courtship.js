export const alienCourtship = `ive been hitchhiking with my heart
to romanticize reality, make an "art"
now fazed by the cloud formations
when i look up or right into your eyes
i wonder about my choices
and how the inevitable haunts us

i don't want to be part of 
sentimental suburban fantasies 
ill stay at my beach of devotion
and collect washed up emotion
like seashells in the sand
and listen to the sound they had 

i suppose through interstellar communication 
they're calling on my interpretation 
of everything i see, feel and am
well, join me in my realm
in intensity we can get lost
wake up from heartbreak, trust
ill steal from guardians, philosophers and artists
to feed the flames we build and keep this, 
ill make up metaphors unbelievably deep
you won't resist to fall for me. `;

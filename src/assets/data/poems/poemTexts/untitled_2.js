the ocean and the sky
colored "beyond dimension"
endless depths and endless heights

have enslaved my attention
to philosophize about their hue
even if beyond perception

of all the colors it was blue
that drove artists mad and broke
and i feel today, it still holds true

when captured by its trope
defying modern chemical heroes
and other anthropogenic jokes

i'm the ceo of heartbreak bureau 
aquarius one, pisces zero.

i want to look back at this point in time
read my work, the drabbles and the rhymes
comment on some overarching thread
like its not just interchangable dread
not just letters to be eccentric 
not just execuses to relive something 
not just pretense and drama 
for the sake, of pretense and drama. 
like how people comment on artists' lifes
oh, look, this is from her paris time;
when his wife left, the style shifted 
you can see it in the colors selected
its a certain period, something to remark
a perfect way to rationalize some scars
i want to have overcome and created
i want to be someone elevated 
i want to be more than organs in a skin 
i want the past few months to mean something.

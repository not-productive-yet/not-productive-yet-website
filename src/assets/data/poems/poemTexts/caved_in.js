forcing inspiration to come out of its cave
secluded with passion and feeling awake
by a bonfire the three of them sit and stare
at the flames projecting daily despair
a dellusional mix of the misplaced mind
rebelling against attempts in redesign
but sitting around and staring at nothing
even in a place that feels like magic
is not excitement enough for them
to grace us with their presence
birds not of prey, but of pray circling overhead
appealing to the self-centered thread
reminding of everything that fell through perception 
and misguided attempts at connection
forcing inspiration to come out of its cave
secluded with passion and feeling the same `;

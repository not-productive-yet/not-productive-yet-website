export const paperBoat = `
like a paper boat, 
in her ocean, i float. 
she's noone in particular, 
i'm just attaching emotion, 
to simulate ligature,
and to simulate depth,
since for me too, 
oceans make up more than 70%,
it's a canvas i paint, 
when i (foreseeably) fixate;
is that what it means to be an artist? 
we're definitely bad for the economy,
and the worst thing is: i wouldn't give it up, 
because honestly,
the bland, unoriginal, lonely, badly thought out, never aligned, mostly the same version of reality
i seem to have found interest in, 
is coming across incredibly depressing,
not really worth the while, 
and sitting in a metaphoric boat, 
lead by the metaphoric undertow,
feels at least a little less horrible.

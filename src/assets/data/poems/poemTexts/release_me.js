export const releaseMe = `
im tired of confusion 
im tired of hope
im tired of wasted potential 
and im tired of things going weird and wrong
you left me here with nothing 
so i ended up making stuff up
its all dellusion and arrogance and lies
how i cling to see beyond your disguise 
and even writing this i won't believe 
that its done between you and me
but i want and have to release, 
for now at least, 
bc i cannot breathe
when i cannot see
and the illusion of your love
is plainly fucking me up.

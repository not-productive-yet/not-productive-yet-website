export const hibernation = `
im at the desert downstairs, 
she's a truly great hostess:
suppling hallucinations 
feeding temptations 
providing for every need
so i forget why i breathe

she'll attend to the fears
so i can lay my head near 
and every time i spill my heart 
she will collect the parts 
then burn them one by one
because in here love is done
-
i dont need anyone's help
its my desert, it's my realm
i know how to escape 
but with this low
i have to hibernate. 
(she'll provide ice and snow)

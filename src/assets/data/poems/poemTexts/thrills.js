export const thrills = `
always out and never still
chasing some disposable thrill 
clutching onto the surface 
to feel safe from the uncertain 

when the pressure grips you tight
you cant tell wrong from right
retreat to a made up reality
built on informal fallicies

but no matter who or what you use
how you hide or where you move
even with the most complicated lies
babe, you wont outrun what's inside

no concept of coherent thought
unsure what timeline I've caught
your lips curl against my neck 
and semantics don't seem worth it

clinging on as if im made of gold
or maybe desperate, as if im to dissolve 
dimensions, planets or equations aligned
so that something long lost we now find

it's impatient and inappropriate
but then again
hearing you lose your composure 
is my new euphoria

calm like i never am
comfortable in a way id forgotten
i lay here with you
and let my lines fade away

i sit at a desk with furious curses
you took this heart and all the exits
a thousand fires i could light
just by thinking of you and i
-
i won't lower to the filth of rationality
especially when it's all pretend anyway 
i almost fell for your avalanche 
now more mad to rhyme avalanche 
-
seems you're just another memory 
to tear apart and exercise creativity
patient in the tall grass ill lay, 
and wait for all of you to fade away.

you left me terrified
that time progressing or me remembering
will somehow, some way
scatter, taint or alter
how loaded i felt in that moment
how emotion was spilled for a moment
how we stood next to the car of your boyfriend
and how beautifully tragic it all felt
i wish i had it stored away forever, somewhere
because
i cant recall how your words aligned
or how the street lamps made you look
i was drunk and high off my mind
but not from anything i took.

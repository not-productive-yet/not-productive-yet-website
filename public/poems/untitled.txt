your eyes, i've evolved to see their color
though not yet far enough to uncover
in your mind like a board of chess
which of the pieces i possess

are we now part of the love club, 
and do you wanna go blow it up?
tell me about the stars, 
and your dreams of all our souls 
i'll talk like im from mars
and where your heart is, i can follow
from athens to patagonia
how's that for eudaimonia?

your eyes, i've evolved to see their color
though not yet past being a sucker
writing things that don't exist
outside my notes-app, i admit.

circles under the eyes
and circles inside the mind
your look is intense, but
even now, full of hope and even lust 
before the party starts -
will you remember the better days
and all the better ways
to free the beauty inside your soul
and sit back on your fated throne
inside the realm you call your own 
will you love 
and will you remember
the flower crown in the corner?

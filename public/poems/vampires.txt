tell me about vampires & french books
about moving to berlin & feeling free
like a fish on a rod, ill be hooked
in time for the 'its not you, its me'

same conversations over and over
looping in my head endlessly 
same bursts of devoted emotion
turned into nothing but daydreams

unspired, defeated & unapproachable 
i'm not made for something this disposable.

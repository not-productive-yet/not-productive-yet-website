i wanna do it all but i feel like im talentless,
i want a love true, but i feel like it's a mess,
noone can convince me to go back there again,
i know it's not ideal, but i need a change.
every day i wonder if i'm lying to my friends,
am i meant for great or for a death meaningless? 
mom says to think about life as an adult
i'm way too naive and it isnt all good;
yes, i might fail, it can all go wrong,
but if i dont try i'll never move on,
and i know you'll come back to drain me,
but it won't be enough to cut my dopamine,
i'll just always want more, it's a fucking curse,
i warned you and now i cant reverse.
so by this time next year when it all goes to shit,
i'll write about a fuck up... get your drink.

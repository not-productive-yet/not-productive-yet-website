i wanna do it all but i feel like im talentless
i want a love true but i feel like its a mess
noone can convince me to go back there again
i know its not ideal but i need a change
every day i wonder if im lying to my friends 
am i meant for great or for a death meaningless 
mom says to think about life as an adult
im way too naive and it isnt all that good
yes i might fail it can all go wrong
but if i dont try ill never move on
and i know youll come back and try to drain me
but it won't be enough to cut my dopamine
ill just always want more its a fucking curse
i warned you and now i cant reverse
so by this time next year when it all goes to shit
ill write about a fuck up... get your drink

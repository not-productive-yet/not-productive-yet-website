maybe the sun blinding my eyes
maybe my breath feeling right 
maybe something dull being beautiful
or maybe if its not me who's dellusional

maybe a place more like home
maybe a book to summon what's beyond
maybe something more sophisticated
or maybe something simple, to erase it. 

maybe then, you'll actually say it? 
im tired of playing mind reading escapist.

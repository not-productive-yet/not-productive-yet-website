do i want to talk, do i want to forget
every day i change my mind. 
an endless thought pool to pretend
its salvageable, we are right. 

i discard what you've done
to fuel hope and connect through art. 
but be it flakiness or dellusion, 
you don't care and there is that. 

you play the game, yet wanna lose
i couldn't see that through your eyes. 
still didn't need to take me down too, 
a lie would have sufficed.
-
maybe you forgot it, babe, 
but it will always stay the same - 
the lion is king of the jungle
and with that, second to noone.
